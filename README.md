# SortingAlgorithmsVisualizer
This is a sorting algorithms visualizer. It divides an image in n sections, it shuffles the image sections and then the user can choose which sorting algorithm to use to order the image.
The image can be specified in the code (hardcoded).
The user can choose the number of sections n, the delay in ms between each movement of the red line and the algorithm to use to order the image.
